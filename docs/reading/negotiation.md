# The Art of Negotiation


## Collaboration
> The adversary is not the person across the table; the adversary is the situation. The person across the table is a counterpart that is struggling with some aspects of the same problem as you are.

Negotiation was seen as a zero-sum game for a long time, but there is a better way.
The idea is to realize that the situation is the adversary, and the person across the table is actually your negotiating partner --- a person who is to be worked with, not against, in pursuit of a mutually beneficial outcome.

Effective negotiation is collaborative. In the spirit of collaboration, your overarching goals should include:

- Doing all you can to show the other side that you are negotiating **in good faith**.
You are not here to deceive or exploit the other side. Sometimes showing deference can be key.
- Becoming genuinely interested in what drives the other side. Understanding their goals, motivations, wants and fears will help you navigate the negotiation effectively.
- Building trust-based influence through the use of **tactical empathy**.
- Work to deactivate negative emotions.
- Aim to magnify positive emotions.

## Tactical empathy
- Empathy is becoming completely aware of the other side's perspective, their point of view, their take on things, how they see it, and wha they feel.
- It is not agreement in any way. It is not compassion, not sympathy.
- Let's tactically take what we know to be the case, and apply it in our interactions.
- If you can really get at what's driving someone, you can change their outlook, and you can change their decision making.
- You have to understand what their rules are, and you have to respect (not necessarily adopt) these.

??? note "Empathy, compassion vs sympathy"
    - Empathy is the **ability** to share another personâ€™s feelings and emotions as if they were your own.
    - Sympathy: If you have sympathy for someone who is in a bad situation, you are sorry for them, and show this in the way you behave toward them.
    - Compassion is a feeling of pity, sympathy, and understanding for someone who is suffering.
