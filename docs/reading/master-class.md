# Master Class

## "Space Exploration" by Chris Hadfield
- The idea that we could fly wasn't part of normal society. Through the combination of a real sense of purpose, and an enormous amount of work on behalf of a lot of people, we can make impossible things happen.
- This class is for anyone who is interested in exploration. Not just exploring space.
You'll learn a lot things along the way to space, about yourself, about how to turn yourself into somebody different than you used to be.


### What it feels like to launch
- It's an incredible morning to wake up, when you know that this is the day that you're leaving Earth.
It's a day that you don't take lightly. It's a day that you've prepared for intensively, your whole life.
- You start focusing in and thinking about nothing else but the moment that you are in. And you need that.
To fly a spaceship, especially a rocket ship, you have to give yourself permission to ignore everything else that exists, just to be ready for all the things that are about to happen.
- The ship can go bad so quickly, and there are so many things you can do to save the day if you can just be ready enough.
- Every second going by is a new window of what you're going to do next if something fails. You're hyper ready to react no matter what this machine does, including if it starts to explode underneath you. All of that is in your head.
- It is an amazing ride. Suddenly, something you have just been dreaming about, something that you never actually let yourself believe what's gonna happen just happened.
Now you are in space, but now really it is just the beginning.

### Leadership; Commanding the ISS (International Space Station)
- The world has only one space station, and so you take that part very seriously as an astronaut, but even more so when you're the commander of it.
- You also have the lives of the people onboard, and it is a dangerous place to be. So you have that added responsibility. Not only of the structure, the cost, and the complexity of the ship, but of the health and ultimately the lives of the other five people onboard.
- It takes a lot more work to be a commander than to be a crew member, but I think it's also more rewarding.
- It you want to lead properly, you have to know what victory looks like.

#### Create strong relationship through leadership
- The other crew member are all super competent astronauts. So you can count on good individual decisions almost all the time.
- The real role of the commander comes in two different times. One is developing, training and building the crew to get ready to launch. The second is if you have a serious problem onboard.
- I worked with my crew through years in preparation. In fact, it was back in my mind a decade **before** I became a commander. I would look around the office.
I would gonna be in space with some of these people, and I don't know which one they are going to be yet, but let's think about what sort of relationship I should have with everybody? How should I be viewed? What type of traits do I need to develop in myself? Which of these people is a great leader? What are they doing that makes them a good leader? How can I modify myself? How can I be in a position that no matter who I'm chosen with, I'm gonna like them and we are gonna be able to work together and do complicated things?
- When you get assigned a crew, then you are trying to make sure that the crew is protected, that they get the training that they need, that they feel fulfilled, that they're pursuing their own personal and profession objectives all the way through the training process.
- The real ultimate test of being a commander is when something goes drastically wrong. You have to respond immediately.
- You're not the only person involved. There are flight directors or equivalents in Huston, Moscow, Munich, Montreal, Tokyo and etc. All of them have responsibility for the space station, and they are making decisions that affect your lives. You have to be constantly working with all of those other external teams as well. **You don't want to wait until you get to orbit to start developing those relationships.** You want to start thinking about that way in advance.
- Understand the people you're working with. Build up the years of mutual understanding, mutual respect and professional competence.

#### Keep preparing, learning and improving
- You can never prepare too early. You've got to be doing something this afternoon; why not think about stuff that's important to you, that's gonna happen, and get a little readier for it?
- Leadership is the art of influencing human behavior to accomplish a mission in the manner desired by the leader.
- The best teacher you can ever have is a bad leader. If the leaders are doing a nice job, you sort of don't even know that they are there. When you see bad leadership, you can learn a lot.
- I tried to learn all the way along, just in case someday somebody put me in a leadership position.

### Training and learning: one-pager
- When you're onboard a spaceship, the amount of information is kind of overwhelming. How do you reset your brain so that the critical information that you needed during that particular activity if fresh?
- A large part of successfully being an astronaut is learning how to manage information, how to learn things, how to keep things in your brain where you need them.
- For me the best way to do that, is just initially learn the whole thing, and then boil it down to the part that is your interface.
- There is big complex theory behind it, but how are you interacting with it. If there is no way for me to interact with it, then it doesn't really matter; it is somebody else's concern, but not mine.
- Start with the big information, boil out the parts that are really critical to you, and put them on a page so that when you're about to do the job, you can read it, and suddenly it is all there in your head.


## "Art of Negotiation" by Chris Voss
### Collaboration
Great negotiation is about collaboration.

> The adversary is not the person across the table; the adversary is the situation. The person across the table is a counterpart that is struggling with some aspects of the same problem as you are.

Negotiation was seen as a zero-sum game for a long time, but there is a better way.
The idea is to realize that the situation is the adversary, and the person across the table is actually your negotiating partner --- a person who is to be worked with, not against, in pursuit of a mutually beneficial outcome.

Effective negotiation is collaborative. In the spirit of collaboration, your overarching goals should include:

- Doing all you can to show the other side that you are negotiating **in good faith**.
You are not here to deceive or exploit the other side. Sometimes showing deference can be key.
- Becoming genuinely interested in what drives the other side. Understanding their goals, motivations, wants and fears will help you navigate the negotiation effectively.
- Building trust-based influence through the use of **tactical empathy**.
- Work to deactivate negative emotions.
- Aim to magnify positive emotions.

### Tactical empathy
- Empathy is becoming completely aware of the other side's perspective, their point of view, their take on things, how they see it, and wha they feel.
- It is not agreement in any way. It is not compassion, not sympathy.
- Let's tactically take what we know to be the case, and apply it in our interactions.
- If you can really get at what's driving someone, you can change their outlook, and you can change their decision making.
- You have to understand what their rules are, and you have to respect (not necessarily adopt) these.

??? note "Empathy, compassion vs sympathy"
    - Empathy is the **ability** to share another personâ€™s feelings and emotions as if they were your own.
    - Sympathy: If you have sympathy for someone who is in a bad situation, you are sorry for them, and show this in the way you behave toward them.
    - Compassion is a feeling of pity, sympathy, and understanding for someone who is suffering.

### Mirroring
- The common misconception about negotiation is that you have to make your argument.
- You need to find out what is possible, and you need to engage the other side in what their thoughts are, so they feel involved in the process, and consequently they want the deal to happen.

Mirroring: simple repetition of 1 to 3 words of what someone just said, using a great tone of voice, genuine curiosity.

- Use mirroring to get the other side feel like they're involved, and to tease out information.
- The other person feels being listened to.
- When people go on with further explanation, they are gonna add more words; they are gonna change their terms.
- Do not say "What do you mean by xxx?". People often thought they chose the perfect words and may feel irritated.
- Mirroring is also a rapport building process. Interesting people are interested. You are interesting to other people because you are interested in them.
- In confrontational conversations, mirroring can avoid fighting.
